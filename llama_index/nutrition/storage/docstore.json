lose weight? Have you been thinking about trying a\nweight-loss program?\n\nYou are not alone. More than 70 percent of U.S. adults are [overweight or have\nobesity](/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity)1 \u2014and\nmany of them try to lose the extra pounds through different kinds of weight-\nloss programs. A number of these programs are advertised in magazines and\nnewspapers, as well as on the radio, TV, and internet. But are they safe? And\nwill they work for you?\n\nHere you\u2019ll find tips on how to choose a program that may help you lose weight\nsafely and keep it off over time. You\u2019ll also learn how to talk with a health\ncare professional about your weight.\n\nYour health care professional may be able to help you make lifestyle changes\nto reach and maintain a [healthy weight](/Dictionary/H/healthy-weight).\nHowever, if you\u2019re having trouble making these lifestyle changes\u2014or if these\nchanges aren\u2019t enough to help you reach and stay at a healthy weight\u2014you may\nwant to consider a weight-loss program or other types of treatment.\n\n## Where do I start?\n\nTalking with a health care professional about your weight is an important\nfirst step. Sometimes, health care professionals may not address issues such\nas healthy eating, physical activity, and weight during general office visits.\nYou may need to raise these issues yourself. If you feel uneasy talking about\nyour weight, bring your questions with you and practice talking about your\nconcerns before your office visit. Aim to work with your health care\nprofessional to improve your health.\n\n![Woman talking with a female health", "doc_id": "58ea0881-8179-4dec-8b3f-828aeaf57e5b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "37ed7ff5220d6650491cec591d80b1af6e04de9afad164ab5796ab2995804521", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 6397, "end": 10040, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "192f311c-63d5-4aaf-8fff-65ff4ecfeba1", "2": "0bdd29b1-2295-4aab-b997-6f20306e41ca", "3": "21aa6721-7393-4b2f-bc72-b4f580a9b3aa"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "21aa6721-7393-4b2f-bc72-b4f580a9b3aa": {"__data__": {"text": "your health care\nprofessional to improve your health.\n\n![Woman talking with a female health care\nprofessional](/-/media/Images/Health-Information/Weight-\nManagement/woman_talking_to_doctor400x266.jpg) Talking with your health care\nprofessional about your weight is an important first step.\n\n### Prepare for your visit\n\nBefore your visit with a health care professional, think about the following\nquestions:\n\n  * How can I change my eating habits so I can be healthier and reach a healthy weight? \n  * How much and what type of physical activity do I think I need to be healthier and reach a healthy weight? \n  * Could I benefit from seeing a nutrition professional or weight-loss specialist, or joining a weight-loss program?\n\nYou can be better prepared for a visit with a health care professional if you\n\n  * write down all of your questions ahead of time\n  * record all of the medicines and [dietary supplements](https://medlineplus.gov/dietarysupplements.html) you take, or bring them with you\n  * write down the types of diets or programs you have tried in the past to lose weight\n  * bring a pen and paper, smartphone, or other mobile device to read your questions and take notes\n\nDuring your visit, a health care professional may\n\n  * review any medical problems you have and medicines you take to see whether they may be affecting your weight or your ability to lose weight\n  * ask you about your eating, drinking, and physical activity habits\n  * determine your [body mass index](/Dictionary/B/Body-Mass-Index---BMI) (BMI) to see whether you\u2019re overweight or have obesity\n\nPeople who are overweight have a BMI between 25.0 and 29.9.

Successful\nweight-loss programs should promote healthy behaviors that help you lose\nweight safely, that you can stick with every day, and that help you keep the\nweight off.\n\nSafe and successful weight-loss programs should include\n\n  * behavioral treatment, also called lifestyle counseling, that can teach you how to develop and stick with healthier eating and physical activity habits\u2014for example, keeping food and activity records or journals\n  * information about getting enough sleep, managing stress, and the benefits and drawbacks of weight-loss medicines\n  * ongoing feedback, monitoring, and support throughout the program, either in person, by phone, online, or through a combination of these approaches\n  * slow and steady weight-loss", "doc_id": "21aa6721-7393-4b2f-bc72-b4f580a9b3aa", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4309a9efad9f1e31cb929b4097bd104a0585518647b267524baad7916e4f1798", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 9979, "end": 13890, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "192f311c-63d5-4aaf-8fff-65ff4ecfeba1", "2": "58ea0881-8179-4dec-8b3f-828aeaf57e5b", "3": "75fc42ab-883e-4792-8e19-c0a74030ec2e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "75fc42ab-883e-4792-8e19-c0a74030ec2e": {"__data__": {"text": "or through a combination of these approaches\n  * slow and steady weight-loss goals\u2014usually 1 to 2 pounds per week (though weight loss may be faster at the start of a program)\n  * a plan for keeping the weight off, including goal setting, self-checks such as keeping a food journal, and counseling support\n\nThe most successful weight-loss programs provide 14 sessions or more of\nbehavioral treatment over at least 6 months\u2014and are led by trained staff.2\n\nSome commercial weight-loss programs have all of these components for a safe\nand successful weight-loss program.

Researchers are studying how well these\nprograms work on their own or together with in-person programs, especially\nlong term. However, experts suggest that these weight-loss programs should\nprovide the following:\n\n  * organized, weekly lessons, offered online or by podcast, and tailored to your personal goals\n  * support from a qualified staff person to meet your goals\n  * a plan to track your progress on changing your lifestyle habits, such as healthy eating and physical activity, using tools such as cellphones, activity counters, and online journals\n  * regular feedback on your goals, progress, and results provided by a counselor through email, phone, or text messages\n  * the option of social support from a group through bulletin boards, chat rooms, or online meetings\n\nWhether a program is online or in person, you should get as much background as\nyou can before you decide to join.\n\n![Woman holding a laptop and sitting on the floor with outstretched\nlegs](/-/media/Images/Health-Information/Weight-\nManagement/woman_using_laptop288x377.jpg) Many weight-loss programs are now\nbeing offered online and through apps for mobile devices.\n\n**Weight-loss programs to avoid**\n\nAvoid weight-loss programs that make any of the following promises:\n\n  * Lose weight without diet or exercise!\n  * Lose weight while eating as much as you want of all your favorite foods!\n  * Lose 30 pounds in 30 days!\n  * Lose weight in specific problem areas of your body!\n\nOther warning signs to look out for include\n\n  * very small print, asterisks, and footnotes, which may make it easy to miss important information\n  * before-and-after photos that seem too good to be true\n  * personal endorsements that may be made up\n\nYou can report false claims or scams by weight-loss programs to the [Federal\nTrade Commission.](https://www.ftc.gov/)\n\n## What questions should I ask about a weight-loss program?\n\nWeight-loss program staff should be able to answer questions about the\nprogram\u2019s features, safety, costs, and results.

Well, it doesn't\nhave to because there are easy things you can do to add flavor to your daily\nroutine\u2014including healthy twists on your favorite foods.\n\nOne key to feeling your best lies in the food you eat. You can start by\nworking with a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN/RD) to make an eating\nplan that works for you. In it, be sure to include the foods you like\u2014and\ndon\u2019t be afraid to try something new.\n\nMost importantly, remember that eating well\u2014and adding activity to your daily\nroutine by moving more\u2014are important ways you can manage diabetes. And we\u2019re\nhere to help you every step of the way.\n\n## Let's get started.\n\n### What does the science say?![Example of Diabetes Plate Method for a\nvegetarian](/sites/default/files/inline-\nimages/DiabetesPlateMethodVegetarian3.jpg)\n\n\"What can I eat?\" is one of the top questions asked by people with diabetes\nwhen they are diagnosed\u2014and our goal is to help answer that question. A panel\nof scientists, doctors, endocrinologists, diabetes educators and dietitians\nreviewed over 600 research articles over the course of five years to see what\ndiets\u2014or eating patterns\u2014work well for people with diabetes. The results were\npublished in our [Nutrition Consensus\nReport](https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/42/5/731).\n\nThe main finding? Everyone's body responds differently to different types of\nfoods and diets, so there is no single \"magic\" diet for diabetes. But you can\nfollow a few simple guidelines to find out what works for you to help manage\nyour blood glucose (blood sugar).\n\n[Get the key\ntakeaways](https://www.diabetes.org/sites/default/files/2019-10/ADV_2019_Consumer_Nutrition_One\nPager.pdf)\n\n### Introducing the Diabetes Plate Method\n\n![The Diabetes Plate Method is an easy way to plan healthy meals with just a\nplate. Start by filling half your plate with nonstarchy vegetables. Fill one\nquarter of your plate with lean protein foods. Then, fill the final quarter of\nyour plate with carbohydrate foods.](/sites/default/files/inline-\nimages/AtE_plate-method-vector_1787742770.jpg)\n\nNo matter which eating pattern works best for you, it can still be hard to\nknow where to start when it comes to building healthy meals that help you\nmanage your blood glucose\u2014while still being tasty.\n\n**That\u2019s where the Diabetes Plate Method comes in.** Using this method, you\ncan create perfectly portioned meals with a healthy balance of vegetables,\nprotein and carbohydrates\u2014without any counting, calculating, weighing or\nmeasuring.\n\n[Learn more](https://www.diabetesfoodhub.org/articles/what-is-the-diabetes-\nplate-method.html)\n\nAnd once you\u2019ve got the Plate Method down, [check out these tasty\nplates](https://www.diabetesfoodhub.org/articles/create-your-plate-simplify-\nmeal-planning-with-the-plate-method.html) for some meal planning inspiration!\nFind articles like this and more from the nutrition experts at the American\nDiabetes Association\u2019s Diabetes Food Hub\u00ae\u2014the premier food and cooking\ndestination for people living with diabetes and their families.\n\n### Antoinette was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes\u2014but she hasn\u2019t let it hold\nher back.\n\n\u201cDuring discharge I was given a sheet of paper of things to eat and things to\navoid. This was supposed to be my guide for my new life. Although I was\noverwhelmed, I was determined that I would not let diabetes control my life.\u201d  \n  \nNow, Antoinette manages her diabetes through a exercise, stress management,\nmedication and a balanced meal plan\u2014and she strives to remove the stigma\nassociated with diabetes and build a community of people actively seeking to\nimprove their health despite their diagnosis.\n\n[ Read", "doc_id": "19eccdb3-dacf-4cd2-bd4c-2a82d37aff57", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "bdc3a31643f304f916c4dec45a7f3a147cfb622cd297364bf43ce21b6bb99cbf", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 16283, "end": 19968, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "4696ffdb-3a58-436b-a5ac-81e9d52573e6", "2": "640b9a03-0523-444d-9c6b-c1f9e21e4cac", "3": "560a7c49-c01f-4c73-b9d7-62405c779a0f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "560a7c49-c01f-4c73-b9d7-62405c779a0f": {"__data__": {"text": "a community of people actively seeking to\nimprove their health despite their diagnosis.\n\n[ Read Antoinette\u2019s story ](https://www.diabetes.org/blog/sharing-my-story-\nantoinette)\n\n[ Learn how to eat well ](https://www.diabetes.org/nutrition/healthy-food-\nchoices-made-easy)\n\n![Antoinette\njogging](/sites/default/files/styles/max_page_container_1024_width/public/2020-09/AntoinetteJogging_0.jpg)\n\n### What you need to know about nutrients\n\nNow that you\u2019ve got the basics, let\u2019s dive into nutrients.\n\nFirst things first: do you use food labels for products that you buy in the\nstore? The food labels on packaging can be a great place to find information\nabout the nutrients in the food you\u2019re purchasing.\n\n[Get smart on food labels](/healthy-living/recipes-nutrition/reading-food-\nlabels/making-sense-food-labels)\n\n![](https://diabetes.org/sites/default/files/styles/750_width/public/2019-04/Nutrition_Carbs-1%402x.jpg)\n\n![](https://diabetes.org/sites/default/files/styles/750_width/public/2019-04/Nutrition_Carbs-2%402x.jpg)\n\n![](https://diabetes.org/sites/default/files/styles/750_width/public/2019-04/Nutrition_Carbs-3%402x.jpg)\n\n### Carbs, carbs, carbs\u2014what about them?\n\nWhen it comes to managing diabetes, the carbohydrates, or carbs, you eat play\nan important role. They impact your blood glucose, so remember that balance is\nkey!\n\nThere are three main types of carbohydrates in food\u2014starches, sugar and fiber.\nAs you\u2019ll see on the nutrition labels for the food you buy, the term \u201ctotal\ncarbohydrate\u201d refers to all three of these types.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing foods with carbs, the goal is to choose carbs that\nare nutrient-dense, which means they are rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals,\nand low in added sugars, sodium and unhealthy fats.\n\n[Learn more about carbs](/healthy-living/recipes-nutrition/understanding-\ncarbs)\n\n[How to eyeball carb servings](/healthy-living/recipes-nutrition/eyeball-\ncarbohydrate-servings)\n\n### How is calcium connected to aging, diabetes, hypoglycemia, and falls?\n\nCalcium is the most abundant mineral in your body and makes up a lot of your\nbones and teeth. It keeps your bones and teeth strong and supports your body\u2019s\noverall structure.

soft\ndrinks](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/sugary-soft-drinks.html) would be\nintroduced in the UK from 2018. Long-time campaigners rejoiced at the news as\nformer chancellor George Osborne declared the government was committed to\ntackling rising rates of [ obesity](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-and-\nobesity.html) and [ type 2\ndiabetes](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/type2-diabetes.html)\n\nThe levy will [ tax the soft drinks\nindustry](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2016/mar/chancellor-george-osborne-\nannounces-tax-of-sugary-soft-drinks-in-budget-2016-93606046.html) for total\nsugar content over 5g per 100ml and apply to drinks such as Coke, Red Bull and\nIrn Bru. It is estimated to raise around \u00a3520 million a year, which will be\nspent on increasing funding sport in primary schools.\n\nBut the road to the 2018 UK sugar tax was not easy. Doctors, campaigners and\nscientists had remained frustrated for years that their calls for a sugar tax\nwere ignored by the government, and before Mr Osborne\u2019s announcement in March\n2016 it", "doc_id": "b186c3cd-56e7-4583-b1b6-dcd7c72c235a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fc45ca25a8636e9a65a17240132003287f40c658a79b6205c4d2fe785c792e5c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 48111, "end": 50844, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "b44fd535-b446-4c16-bf81-c1a5eb13c92a", "2": "6d381538-eaff-4781-bac1-3143a6f0a90d", "3": "19daefc9-c063-4627-8e01-6b29a13bd003"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "19daefc9-c063-4627-8e01-6b29a13bd003": {"__data__": {"text": "by the government, and before Mr Osborne\u2019s announcement in March\n2016 it appeared that their pleas were going unheard.\n\n##  Doctors and scientists unite\n\nIn July 2015 the British Medical Association (BMA) [ urged the\ngovernment](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2015/jul/introduce-a-20-per-cent-\nsugar-tax,-urge-leading-doctors-92332816.html) to introduce a 20 per cent tax\non sugar, saying it would combat escalating rates of obesity and type 2\ndiabetes. The report was well received by sugar tax campaigners such as Action\non Sugar and celebrity chef Jamie Oliver.\n\nJust two weeks later a University of Cambridge study highlighted why a sugar\ntax could be so beneficial. Their researchers discovered that 8,000 cases of\ntype 2 diabetes a year were [ linked to sugary drinks\nconsumption](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2015/jul/8,000-cases-of-\ntype-2-diabetes-a-year-linked-to-sugary-drink-consumptio,-report-\nclaims-93023068.html)\n\nWe then investigated [ how a proposed sugar tax would\nwork](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/in-depth/should-the-government-implement-a-\nsugar-tax-on-fizzy-drinks/) in the UK and whether, politically, it would be\njustifiable in implementing.\n\nAt this point, Mexico was having great success with its sugar tax: sales of\nsugary soft drinks had been reduced by six per cent in its first year. [ [239]\n](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/references.html#239) But in late-2015 it didn\u2019t\nseem that the UK government had any intention of introducing anything similar.\n\nDavid Cameron responded to a Public Health England (PHE) report calling for\nmeasures to tackle obesity by saying there were \" [ more effective ways of\ntackling obesity](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2015/oct/david-cameron-\nrules-out-sugar-tax-despite-new-public-health-england-report-91061759.html) \"\nthan a sugar tax.\n\nBut the concept kept generating more support, with more and more global\norganisations getting involved. In November 2015 the International Diabetes\nFederation (IDF) added their backing [ for world leaders to use sugar\ntaxes](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2015/nov/idf-urge-world-leaders-to-tax-\nsugar,-reduce-obesity-and-type-2-diabetes-rates-92786961.html) in fighting\nobesity and type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe turn of 2016 further put pressure on the government. Queen Mary University\nscientists in London concluded that [ reducing sugar in soft drinks by 40 per\ncent over](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2016/jan/Reducing-sugar-in-\nsweetened-drinks-could-prevent-type-2-diabetes-and-obesity,-study-\nreports-97627527.html) five years could prevent 300,000 cases of type 2\ndiabetes and 1.5m cases of obesity in the UK.\n\nWhile the studies came thick and fast, the government backtracked, [ delaying\nits childhood obesity\nstrategy](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2016/feb/government-again-delays-\nchildhood-obesity-strategy,-sugar-tax-unlikely-to-be-included-91965025.html)\nand tentatively suggested that a sugar tax was unlikely to be included.\n\nThe delay was described by \u201cunacceptable\u201d by campaigners as the government\nrescheduled its long-awaited strategy for the summer of 2016.\n\n##  The sugar tax is announced\n\nIt came as a surprise to many when Mr Osborne included a planned sugar tax as\npart of the 2016 Budget in March.\n\nSpeaking at the House of Commons, Mr Osborne", "doc_id": "19daefc9-c063-4627-8e01-6b29a13bd003", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5d3c3ea2b72e02bd4e17c0c5f237ff0a0740c994c17ad15ed9673bb0ebb1af85", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 50783, "end": 54057, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "b44fd535-b446-4c16-bf81-c1a5eb13c92a", "2": "b186c3cd-56e7-4583-b1b6-dcd7c72c235a", "3": "a32b9652-dfda-4e6b-a8ce-e50a45d7dbdd"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a32b9652-dfda-4e6b-a8ce-e50a45d7dbdd": {"__data__": {"text": "the 2016 Budget in March.\n\nSpeaking at the House of Commons, Mr Osborne said: \"I am not prepared to look\nback at my time here in this Parliament, doing this job and say to my\nchildren's generation 'I'm sorry.

But we ducked the difficult decisions and\nwe did nothing'.\"\n\nIt was revealed that manufacturers of soft drinks will be taxed on the volume\nthey produce or import. Drinks will fall into two bands: one for total sugar\ncontent over 5g per 100ml, and a second band for drinks with more than 8g per\n100ml.\n\nThe tax will not directly affect consumers, but some people with diabetes were\nleft wondering if it meant hypo treatments such as Lucozade would become more\nexpensive. We looked at the [ maths behind the\ntax](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/blog/2016/03/sugar-tax-type-1-diabetes-cause-\nfor-complaint/) and sought to assuage the diabetes community regarding

major criticism\nwas the introduction of a voluntary target for the food and drink industry to\nreduce sugar in products by 20 per cent, which was deemed \u201cpointless\u201d.\n\n\"Although the government proposes targets for food companies to reduce the\nlevel of sugar in their products, the fact that these are voluntary and not\nbacked up by regulation renders them pointless,\" said Professor Parveen Kumar,\nthe BMA board of science chair.\n\nThe strategy was also censured for failing to include a ban of junk food\npromotions in supermarkets and restricting junk advertising to children\nthrough television \u2013 two measures previously recommended by PHE.\n\nLater in 2016, the Committee on Advertising Practice (CAP) eventually\nannounced that a ban for online junk food

Looking ahead to 2018\n\nThe soft drinks industry already seems to be mobilising towards 2018\npreparations, with PepsiCo announcing in October 2016 [ that their most

But\nrecent studies undertaken to assess their benefits have delivered a flurry of\ndisappointing results. The supplements failed to prevent Alzheimer's disease,\ncancer, heart attacks, strokes, [type 2\ndiabetes](https://www.consumerreports.org/health/conditions-and-\ntreatments/type-2-diabetes/patient-power-toolkit/index.htm), and premature\ndeath.\n\n\"We have yet to see well-conducted research that categorically supports the\nuse of vitamin and mineral supplements,\" says Linda Van Horn, Ph.D., a\nprofessor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School\nof Medicine in Chicago. \"Most studies show no benefit, or actual harm.\"\n\n### The power of food\n\nWhile some people may need supplements [at certain stages of their\nlives](https://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/diet-\nnutrition/vitamins-supplements/vitamins/when-supplements-help/vitamins-when-\nsupplements-help.htm \"at certain stages of their lives\"), nutritional\ndeficiencies are uncommon in the U.S. \"Almost all of us get or can get the\nvitamins and minerals we need from our diet,\" says Paul M. Coates, Ph.D.,\ndirector of the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of\nHealth (NIH).\n\nMajor health organizations for cancer, diabetes, and heart disease all advise\nagainst supplements in favor of a healthful diet rich in fruits, vegetables,\nwhole grains, and legumes. Unlike pills, those foods contain fiber plus\nthousands of health-protective substances that seem to work together more\npowerfully than any single ingredient can work alone. \"That's why it's\ndangerous to say, 'I know I don't eat well, but if I pop my vitamins, I'm\ncovered,' \" says Karen Collins, R.D., nutrition adviser to the American\nInstitute for Cancer Research. \"We now know that you're not covered.\"\n\n### Too much can harm\n\nAnother concern is that some vitamin pills can be toxic if taken in high doses\nfor a long time. Studies show that beta-carotene pills, for example, can\nincrease the risk of lung cancer in smokers, and a 2008 review suggests that\nthe pills, plus supplemental doses of the vitamins A and E, may increase the\nrisk of premature death. In addition, a government survey found that more than\n11 percent of adults take at least 400 international units of vitamin E a day,\na dose that has been linked to heart failure, strokes, and an increased risk\nof death.\n\nPeople are also apt to combine vitamin tablets and fortified foods, which can\ncause problems. For instance, too much folic acid\u2014added to wheat products in\nthis country\u2014can mask vitamin B12 deficiency. Untreated, that can lead to\nirreversible nerve damage. In addition, high doses of folic acid may be\nassociated with an increased risk of precancerous colon polyps, according to a\ntrial of some", "doc_id": "2f55dfee-3bfd-4777-b2b9-8601e140ffe3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f56c16f7966a1b353eec915c0decb0e9f17872fe227e1a967f781ba943d675a4", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 37378, "end": 40820, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "baf0ee69-2455-40a6-9245-c882938a1b13", "2": "7b9f61ad-e62f-43f4-a762-6672f0622a34", "3": "d12ff0fe-31d5-40c2-8470-37ccf839761d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d12ff0fe-31d5-40c2-8470-37ccf839761d": {"__data__": {"text": "polyps, according to a\ntrial of some 1,000 people at risk for them. \"We're getting several alarming\nsignals that more may not be better,\" says Susan T. Mayne, Ph.D., a professor\nof epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health.\n\nYet despite the unfavorable results, vitamin and mineral pills are widely used\nto fend off diseases. Read on to find [our review of the latest evidence on\ntheir effects](https://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/diet-\nnutrition/vitamins-supplements/vitamins/when-supplements-strike-out/vitamins-\nwhen-supplements-strike-out.htm \"our review of the latest evidence on their\neffects\").\n\n## Supplements strike out\n\n![](https://article.images.consumerreports.org/f_auto/prod/content/dam/cro/news_articles/health/article_vitamins)\n\nPill problems\n\nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of supplements to prevent\nthe following conditions:\n\n**Cancer.** Two large trials published in 2009 came up empty. In one,\nsponsored by the National Cancer Institute, researchers reported that vitamin\nE and the mineral selenium failed to prevent prostate cancer. In fact,\nresearchers noted possible increased risks of prostate cancer from vitamin E,\nand of type 2 diabetes from selenium. The second study, the Physicians' Health\nStudy II, found that neither vitamin C nor E reduced the risk of colon, lung,\nprostate, or other cancers in men. And women haven't fared much better: Folic\nacid and certain other B vitamins provided no protection against breast or any\nother cancer in one study, and calcium and [vitamin\nD](https://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/diet-\nnutrition/vitamins-supplements/vitamin-d/overview/vitamin-d-ov.htm \"vitamin\nD\") had no effect on breast-cancer risk in another.\n\nSome research suggests that vitamin and mineral supplements may pose\nparticular risks to people who are being treated for cancer. While many cancer\npatients take antioxidant supplements such as vitamins C, E, and beta-carotene\nwith the hope of reducing the toxicity of chemotherapy and radiation, a 2008\nreview found that the practice may protect cancer cells as well as normal\nones. As a result, many oncologists now advise patients not to use antioxidant\npills during those treatments.\n\n**Heart disease.** Folic acid and other B vitamins failed to prevent heart\nattacks, strokes, and death from cardiovascular disease in women at risk for\nheart disease in a 2008 trial by the Harvard Medical School. And neither\nvitamin C nor E prevented those events in men in the Physicians' Health Study\nII. Vitamin E, however, was linked to an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke.\n\nAntioxidant supplements were previously thought to prevent fatty buildups in\narteries, but research now suggests that they may worsen cholesterol levels\nand blunt the effects of cholesterol-lowering drugs. A 2009 review found that\ndiets rich in those vitamins protected people from heart disease but\nsupplements of them did not, underscoring the power of a healthy diet.\n\n**Type 2 diabetes.** In a 2009 trial, vitamin and mineral pills didn't reduce\nthe risk of metabolic syndrome--a cluster of symptoms including abdominal\nobesity and high levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and blood sugar--that can\nlead to [type 2 diabetes](https://www.consumerreports.org/health/conditions-\nand-treatments/type-2-diabetes/patient-power-toolkit/index.htm). Additional\n2009 studies found that vitamin pills didn't prevent type 2 diabetes and might\nundermine the ability of exercise to improve blood sugar levels. And while\nmany people with diabetes take supplements of the mineral chromium to control\nblood sugar and lose weight, that benefit is unproven.\n\n**Cognitive", "doc_id": "d12ff0fe-31d5-40c2-8470-37ccf839761d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "02e644365d549a50b5f852adb623bfd45fc6f4ed970b9f4f4599a9e20f45c78a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 40790, "end": 44456, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "baf0ee69-2455-40a6-9245-c882938a1b13", "2": "2f55dfee-3bfd-4777-b2b9-8601e140ffe3", "3": "1464be05-da65-4fa0-9f5c-c3a4c1191b07"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1464be05-da65-4fa0-9f5c-c3a4c1191b07": {"__data__": {"text": "benefit is unproven.\n\n**Cognitive decline.** B vitamins didn't slow Alzheimer's disease, and vitamin\nE failed to prevent dementia in people with cognitive impairment, according to\ntrials from the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, an NIH-funded\nconsortium. Another study suggested that high doses of vitamin E slowed the\nprogression of moderate dementia, but most specialists are wary because of the\npotential risks, says Paul Aisen, M.D., director of the consortium.\n\nOn the other hand, a deficiency of vitamin B12 or thyroid hormone can cause\ncognitive impairment, so if you're declining more than normal for your age,\nyou should be tested for those conditions. \"But speak to your physician,\"\nAisen says. \"You can't necessarily replenish low B12 stores on your own.\"\n\n**Immune function.** The evidence on whether vitamin and mineral supplements\ncan enhance [immunity](https://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-\nliving/news/2008/12/immunity/overview/boosting-your-immunity-ov.htm\n\"immunity\") is contradictory, especially for people who eat adequately. And\nwhile supplements can boost immune response in older people with nutritional\ndeficiencies, it's still not known if that results in fewer infections. \"In\nthe vast majority of people, taking megadoses is not recommended, and may be\nharmful,\" says Kevin High, M.D., chief of infectious diseases at Wake Forest\nUniversity School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C. An excess of vitamin E,\nfor instance, can backfire.\n\n## When a supplement might make sense\n\nVitamin and mineral pills can benefit certain people at different times in\ntheir lives, and some of those instances are listed below. But discuss the\nneed for supplements with your physician first. They may be risky for some\npeople and interfere with medications, or you may need a higher dose and\ndifferent form. When possible, look for products labeled \"USP-verified,\" which\nmeets standards for quality, purity, and potency.\n\nSupplement | Recommended groups | Daily amount | Form  \n---|---|---|---  \nVitamin B12 | People over age 50; strict vegetarians | At least 2.4 mcg from\ndiet, supplements, or fortified foods | Pills and dissolvable lozenges appear\nto be equally effective  \nCalcium | People age 50 and older; strict vegetarians | 1,000 mg for adults\nunder age 50, and 1,200 mg for people age 50 and older from food and\nsupplements | Whatever is cheapest and most palatable; absorption appears\nhighest in doses under 500 mg at a time  \nVitamin D | People age 50 and older; adults with limited sun exposure | 800 to\n1,000 IU from fortified foods and supplements | Vitamin D3 may be more potent\nthan vitamin D2  \nEye supplement | People with at least moderate macular degeneration in one or\nboth eyes | A formula containing 500 mg of vitamin C, 15 mg of beta-carotene,\n400 IU of vitamin E, 80 mg of zinc oxide, and 2 mg of copper | Name-brand or\ngeneric versions are acceptable; dollar store and deep discount brands may be\nsubstandard  \nIron | Premenopausal women with heavy periods | 8 mg for ages 9 to 13; 15 mg\nfor ages 14 to 18; 18 mg for ages 19 to 50 | Ferrous iron is best absorbed  \n  \n## For eye disease, bone loss\n\nSome evidence supports the use of supplements for these conditions:\n\n**Eye disease.** People who have at least moderate age-related macular\ndegeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness, may be able to limit further\ndamage by taking a daily supplement that contains vitamins C, E, and beta-\ncarotene. But talk with your ophthalmologist first, since the formula could be\nrisky for some people.\n\nRecent research suggests that folic acid and other B vitamins reduce the risk\nof developing", "doc_id": "1464be05-da65-4fa0-9f5c-c3a4c1191b07", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "aa71e4939deef948647317d5ffacc86fc505b177ae1b0b3c836f709023600e16", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 44457, "end": 48095, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "baf0ee69-2455-40a6-9245-c882938a1b13", "2": "d12ff0fe-31d5-40c2-8470-37ccf839761d", "3": "39a01294-f0c7-432b-8248-bee2a228692d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "39a01294-f0c7-432b-8248-bee2a228692d": {"__data__": {"text": "reduce the risk\nof developing AMD for some people. \"This is the first suggestion of a way of\npreventing the early stages of AMD other than avoiding smoking,\" says William\nG. Christen, Sc.D., an associate professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital in\nBoston. But the study, sponsored by the National Eye Institute, needs to be\nrepeated before firm recommendations can be made.\n\n**Osteoporosis.** In a recent comprehensive review of 167 studies, the federal\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that calcium and [vitamin\nD](https://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/diet-\nnutrition/vitamins-supplements/vitamin-d/overview/vitamin-d-ov.htm \"vitamin\nD\") pills reduced fractures and bone loss--although the fracture benefit was\nprimarily only in female nursing-home residents. Vitamin D alone also helped\nprevent falls in older people in a 2009 analysis, but only at doses of 700 IU\na day or higher.\n\nShortfalls of vitamin D are common, recent research suggests, so if you have\nhealth problems possibly linked to abnormal calcium metabolism or vitamin D\ndeficiency such as hyperthyroidism and osteoporosis, consider having your\nblood levels tested. If your reading is low, your doctor will probably\nprescribe a high-dose vitamin D supplement for a few months, and then retest.\n\n### When a supplement might make sense\n\nVitamin and mineral pills [can benefit certain people at different times in\ntheir lives](https://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/diet-\nnutrition/vitamins-supplements/vitamins/when-supplements-help/vitamins-when-\nsupplements-help.htm \"can benefit certain people at different times in their\nlives\"). But discuss the need for supplements with your physician first. They\nmay be risky for some people and interfere with medications, or you may need a\nhigher dose and different form. When possible, look for products labeled \"USP-\nverified,\" which meets standards for quality, purity, and potency.\n\n## Who really needs a multi?\n\nThe evidence that multivitamins offer little if any protection for the average\nperson keeps growing. For example, researchers from the Women's Health\nInitiative studied more than 161,000 women, comparing those who took the pills\nwith those who didn't. After eight years, they detected no benefit. Still,\nthere are some groups of people who may benefit from them.\n\n**Dieters.** Most people who need to lose weight can cut calories and still\nget all the nutrients they need from food. But if a health-care professional\nadvises cutting calories severely, you should consider taking a multivitamin.\n\n**Strict vegetarians.** Unless they eat fortified foods, vegetarians who\nexclude eggs and dairy products can have inadequate amounts of calcium,\nvitamin B12, iron, and zinc. They could consider a multivitamin, though they\nmay be better off with single supplements, since multis may not have enough of\nthe nutrients they need and too much of those they don't.\n\n**People with certain disorders.** Those include conditions that impair the\nability to digest or absorb nutrients, or illnesses that deplete them. If you\nhave a medical reason for taking a supplement, you should get advice from your\ndoctor about what to take and how much. You may need more absorbable forms and\nhigher doses than multivitamins provide.\n\n**People with poor diets, especially the very old.** People who don't eat\nenough to maintain their weight might need more than a standard multivitamin.\nThey should consult a doctor or dietitian.\n\n**Women who are pregnant, tryin to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.** Many\npregnant women consume less than the 400 micrograms of folic acid a day that\nhelps prevent neural-tube defects in newborns. Pregnant and breast-feeding\nwomen also need more of other nutrients, notably calcium and iron.

But\nhow do you maintain an eating routine and diet that keeps you and your family\nhealthy and works within your lifestyle and budget?\n\n## Articles\n\n##\n\nResult  \\-  of\n\n[ View All ](https://www.health.harvard.edu/topics/nutrition/all)\n\n## What is nutrition and why is nutrition important?\n\nAt the most basic level, nutrition is about eating a regular, balanced diet.\nGood nutrition helps fuel your body. The foods you eat supply the nutrients\nyour body needs to maintain your brain, muscle, bone, nerves, skin, blood\ncirculation, and immune system. Proper nutrition also helps protect you from\nillness and disease, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and\nosteoporosis.\n\nThere are two major classes of nutrients in food: macronutrients and\nmicronutrients. Macronutrients are carbohydrates, protein, and fat. They\nsupply energy (in the form of calories) and serve as the building blocks for\nmuscles and tissues.\n\nIn comparison, micronutrients are individual [vitamins and\nminerals](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-best-foods-for-\nvitamins-and-minerals). They are divided into four categories: water-soluble\nvitamins, fat-soluble vitamins, microminerals, and trace minerals.\n\n## What foods are healthy?\n\nFor optimal health, science supports following a [plant-based\ndiet](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-right-plant-based-\ndiet-for-you) like the [Mediterranean-DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop\nHypertension) diet](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/a-practical-guide-to-\nthe-mediterranean-diet-2019032116194), and MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Diet\nIntervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet. Plant-based diets have been\nshown to have various health benefits and are linked with a lower risk of\nheart disease, cancer, and other chronic illnesses.\n\nWith so many food options available with plant-based diets, there are many\nhealthy recipes you can make.\n\nWhile most foods in plant-based diets offer important health benefits, certain\nones stand out. These \"superfoods\" pack the biggest nutritional punch. People\nshould try to eat some of these healthy foods every day or as often as\npossible. They include the following:\n\n  * Berries. High in fiber, berries are naturally sweet, and their rich colors mean they are high in antioxidants and disease-fighting nutrients.\n  * Fatty fish. Fatty fish can be a good source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids, which help prevent heart disease. Those with the highest omega-3 content are salmon, mackerel, trout, anchovies, and sardines.\n  * Leafy greens. Dark, leafy greens are a good source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and calcium, as well as several phytochemicals (chemicals made by plants) that [fight", "doc_id": "283b2df3-f15c-4207-970d-15f9a26ac6bb", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "74ce46a404f1a6d013d254b02b70b8006bcd3714491d7f2452ae5939fbf9aead", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 5046, "end": 8385, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ecfc0292-9f34-4c9a-a134-202cbf659051", "2": "7a8d7045-576f-4113-88e0-87ac9aa68a6d", "3": "25d91a4d-69c8-4082-9bf6-d363e09ceab9"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "25d91a4d-69c8-4082-9bf6-d363e09ceab9": {"__data__": {"text": "as well as several phytochemicals (chemicals made by plants) that [fight inflammation](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/5-inflammation-fighting-food-swaps-2021051022570) and protect cells from damage.\n  * [Nuts](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/nuts-all-theyre-cracked-up-to-be). Hazelnuts, walnuts, almonds, and pecans are good plant protein sources. They also contain monounsaturated fats, which may be a factor in reducing the risk of heart disease.\n  * [Olive oil](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/adding-more-olive-oil-to-your-diet-may-help-prevent-an-early-death). Olive oil is a good source of vitamin E, polyphenols, and monounsaturated fatty acids, all of which help reduce the risk of heart disease.\n  * Whole grains. A good source of soluble and insoluble fiber, whole grains also contain several B vitamins and minerals. They have been shown to lower cholesterol and protect against heart disease and diabetes.\n  * Yogurt. A good source of calcium and protein, yogurt contains live cultures called [probiotics](https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/are-you-getting-essential-nutrients-from-your-diet). These \"good bacteria\" can protect the body from other harmful bacteria.\n  * Cruciferous vegetables. These include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens, kale, kohlrabi, mustard greens, radishes, and turnips. They are an excellent source of fiber, vitamins, and phytochemicals, which may help prevent some types of cancer. \n  * Legumes. This broad category includes kidney, black, red, and garbanzo beans, soybeans, and peas. Legumes are an excellent source of fiber, folate, and protein; studies show they can help reduce the risk of heart disease.\n\nWhat does a typical healthy meal from a plant-based diet look like? A great\nvisual guide is the [Harvard Healthy Eating\nPlate](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-plate/). It\nshows the proportions of the healthy foods you should eat. At most meals, try\nto fill half of your plate with vegetables and fruit, a quarter with whole\ngrains, and the final quarter with lean protein.\n\n## Should you take daily vitamins?\n\n\"Dietary supplement\" is an umbrella term. It includes individual vitamins,\nsuch as A, B, C, D, E, and K, and minerals like calcium,\n[multivitamins](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/why-are-you-taking-a-\nmultivitamin-202207262787) (a product that contains 10 or more vitamins,\nminerals, or both), and specialized senior or gender-specific formulas that\ncontain various combinations of vitamins, minerals, and other compounds.\n\nShould you take a daily supplement?\n\nEven though supplements are popular, there is limited evidence they offer\nsignificant health benefits or help protect against disease. For the average\nhealthy adult, eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables\n[provides all the essential vitamins and\nminerals](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/best-source-of-\nvitamins-your-plate-not-your-medicine-cabinet).\n\nHowever, there are situations when people may need a dietary supplement, such\nas those diagnosed with a vitamin deficiency that's been confirmed by a blood\ntest, those who have trouble getting certain vitamins from foods, or those who\nsuffer from conditions that require extra vitamins or minerals.\n\nFor example, strict vegans may not get enough vitamin B-12, which is found\nprimarily in animal products. Low levels of vitamins B-12 and", "doc_id": "25d91a4d-69c8-4082-9bf6-d363e09ceab9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d9bcee681b402f902379420055bba25bef32ab70308933c14064064eb23340e9", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 8356, "end": 11806, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ecfc0292-9f34-4c9a-a134-202cbf659051", "2": "283b2df3-f15c-4207-970d-15f9a26ac6bb", "3": "c3884898-59bd-42fc-a96a-53977b55cd59"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3884898-59bd-42fc-a96a-53977b55cd59": {"__data__": {"text": "which is found\nprimarily in animal products. Low levels of vitamins B-12 and B-6 can stem\nfrom digestive disorders, such as Crohn's disease, celiac disease, and\nulcerative colitis, conditions that make it difficult to absorb nutrients.\nAdults diagnosed with osteoporosis may require extra vitamin D and calcium\nbeyond what they get from their regular diet. Moreover, people who are lactose\nintolerant, and avoid dairy products, may not get enough vitamin D and\ncalcium.\n\nDoctors have differing opinions about dietary supplements. Some believe they\nare not necessary. Others take a \"might-help-won't-hurt\" approach to fill in\nnutritional gaps in one's diet. And studies have shown that taking dietary\nsupplements as prescribed usually doesn't cause serious issues.\n\nIf you want to explore taking a supplement, first check with your doctor. He\nor she can advise whether they are needed and help choose the appropriate\nover-the-counter brand. The FDA monitors disease-related claims on dietary\nsupplement labels but does not ensure whether a product contains the\ningredients listed on its label.\n\n## Nutrition for older adults\n\nProper nutrition becomes even more important after men and women reach age 50.\nIt helps keep energy levels up and protects against many age-related illnesses\nand diseases like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.  \n  \nBut is there a best diet for men and women over 50?  \n  \nThere is no single way to eat for good health. While everyone needs\ncarbohydrates, fat, and protein, there is no \"magic\" ratio that you should\nstrive for as long as you avoid extremes. In fact, recent studies have found\nthat the quality of the food is more important than whether it's low-fat, low-\ncarb, or somewhere in between.  \n  \nWhile details may vary from diet to diet, all healthy eating plans have four\nbasic principles in common:  \n\n\n  1. Lots of plants. Plant foods--vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds--offer a wealth of vitamins and minerals. They also contain fiber and healthful compounds called phytochemicals, natural substances in plants that provide a range of health benefits, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and even anti-cancer activity.\n  2. Adequate [protein](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/protein-intake-associated-with-less-cognitive-decline). Abundant research shows it's essential to eat enough protein. There are many protein sources, but plant protein (beans, lentils, soy foods, nuts, seeds) and fish offer the most health benefits.\n  3. Minimally processed foods. A diet high in [ultra-processed foods](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/cutting-back-on-ultra-processed-foods-linked-with-lower-dementia-risk) causes weight gain and unhealthy shifts in blood sugar and cholesterol. Food processing often strips away nutrients while adding extra fats, sugars, sodium, additives, and preservatives.\n  4. Limited saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium. The U.S. government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting saturated fat intake to less than 10% of daily calories. The same goes for added sugars (sugars added during processing). As for sodium, keep it below 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day--the average American consumes far too much, more than 3,400 mg per day.\n\n## Meal prep ideas\n\nHealthy eating doesn't have to be hard. With a bit of preparation and\nplanning, it can be easy to [create healthy\nmeals](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/cooking-\nskills/meal-planning/heart-healthy-kitchen-essentials-for-meal-prep) for the\nentire week.

Meal prep has many benefits: It can help save time and money and\nhelp with portion control for weight management. It also reduces the stress of\ndaily decisions about what to eat.  \n  \nHere are some steps on how to meal prep.  \n  \nGather meal ideas. Collect healthy recipes and save them in a binder or copy\nrecipe links onto an online spreadsheet. Consider specific meals or foods for\ndifferent days of the week, like Meatless Mondays, Whole Grain Wednesdays, and\nStir-Fry Fridays.  \n  \nBegin small: Create enough dinners for two to three days of the week, and then\ngo from there.  \n  \nPick a day. Choose a specific day of the week to do the following:\n\n  1. Plan the menu (whether weekly or several days) and write out your grocery list.\n  2. Grocery shop.\n  3. Meal prep.\n\nSome of these days may overlap but breaking up these tasks can keep meal\nplanning manageable.  \n  \nCook in order. On meal prep day, focus first on foods that take the longest to\ncook. If you prefer not to pre-cook proteins, consider marinating poultry,\nfish, or even tofu on your prep day so you can pop them into the oven or stir-\nfry them later in the week.  \n  \nMulti-task. While foods are baking or bubbling on the stovetop, chop\nvegetables and fresh fruit, or wash and dry salad greens for later in the\nweek.  \n  \nMake extras. When possible, make extra portions of recipes for another day or\ntwo of meals, or freeze them for the following week.  \n  \nStorage. Label all prepped items with a date so that you can track when to use\nthem.
