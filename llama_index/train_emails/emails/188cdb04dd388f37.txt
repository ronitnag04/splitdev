Subject: Hey, Just Wanted to Say Hi
Hey Julia,
I hope this email finds you doing well. I just wanted to take a moment to
reach out and say hi. We've been classmates for a while now, and I've
always admired your [insert something specific you appreciate about them,
such as intelligence, sense of humor, kindness, etc.].
I wanted to let you know that I enjoy our interactions in class and think
you're a really interesting person. It would be great to spend more time
getting to know you outside of the classroom setting, if you're open to it.
No pressure at all, just wanted to express my interest and let you know
that I think you're pretty awesome. Feel free to respond whenever you have
the time.
Take care and have a fantastic day!
Warm regards,
