Dude, You're a Trainwreck
Yo Adi,
Dude, I've seen train wrecks that are smoother than you. You're a living,
breathing disaster. It's like watching a car crash in slow motion every
time you attempt to contribute something in class.
I don't know if you're doing this on purpose or if you're genuinely this
dense, but either way, it's painful to witness. Your lack of understanding
is on a whole new level, and it's a miracle how you haven't been kicked out
yet.
Save us all the agony, bro, and sit quietly in the corner. The rest of us
are trying to salvage what little brain cells we have left after
interacting with you.
Stay wrecked,
