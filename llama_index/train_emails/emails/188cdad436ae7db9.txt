Yo, What's Your Deal?
Yo Adi,
I gotta ask, what's your deal, bruh? I mean, seriously, you're like the
human embodiment of a brain fart. It's mind-blowing how you manage to screw
up the simplest tasks. Do you even have a functioning brain or are you just
coasting through life on dumb luck?
I can't front, your presence in class is like a bad smell that won't go
away. You're a walking, talking embarrassment, and it's a wonder how you
made it this far. Maybe it's time to consider a career that doesn't involve
using your brain, 'cause clearly, that ain't your strong suit.
Next time you open your mouth or attempt anything remotely intellectual, do
us all a favor and save yourself the embarrassment. Stay silent and let the
real players handle the game.
Stay irrelevant,
