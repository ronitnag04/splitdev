Subject: Disappointed with the Service
Hello,

I am writing to express my disappointment with the service I received at
your establishment. The staff was unresponsive, and the overall experience
was below my expectations. I hope you can make the necessary improvements
to avoid similar situations in the future.

Regards,
SPLIT
