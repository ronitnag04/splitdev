Wake Up, Teach
Hey Teach,

Your teaching sucks. It's boring, repetitive, and I can't stand it. Your
outdated fashion sense doesn't help either. You're just a cog in the
system, out of touch with reality.

I've tried giving you a chance, but you keep recycling the same
assignments. You don't care about our interests, only your own agenda.

You may have the authority to grade me, but you can't crush my spirit. I
won't conform to your archaic rules. I'm a free spirit, ready to make my
mark on the world.

Step up or get out of the way, Teach. We don't need you holding us back.

No love,
